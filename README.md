This repository demonstrates the use of **PL/SQL Collections**, **Records**, and the **GOTO** statement through a small project that calculates employee bonuses by department.

## 📘 Project Overview

The project simulates a company’s bonus allocation system.  
It includes:
- A database schema for **departments**, **employees**, and **bonuses**
- PL/SQL **record types** for employee and bonus data
- **Collections** (associative arrays and nested tables) to store and process data in memory
- A **GOTO** statement to skip certain employees (e.g., those on leave)
- A stored procedure that calculates and stores employee bonuses
- A report procedure to print bonus details
